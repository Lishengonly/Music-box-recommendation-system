# Music-box-recommendation-system
The goal of this project is to build a song recommendation system for users of MusicBox App with their listening and downloading history. The models are evaluted by MAE, test accuracy and confidance of association rules.

The data covers about 110k users and 1 million songs. The original dataset provided by the [[Million Song]] (projecthttps://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/)


The project is carried out in 7 steps:
* Understand&Define problems 
* Data preprocessing	
* Data Exploration
* Algorithm development
* Model selection
* Model validation&iteration
* Discussion&Conclusions
